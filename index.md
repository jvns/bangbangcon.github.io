ten-minute talks** (with lots of breaks, of course!) to celebrate the
joyous, exciting, and surprising moments in computing.  Join us for our **fifth year** in 2018!</p>

**Mimi Onuoha** is a Brooklyn-based artist and researcher investigating the social results of data collection and computational categorization. Her work uses code, writing, performance, and objects to explore missing data and the ways in which people are abstracted, represented, and classified.

Onuoha has been in residence at Eyebeam, the Data & Society Research Institute, Columbia Universityâ€™s Tow Center, and the Royal College of Art. She has exhibited and presented workshops in festivals internationally, and in 2014 she was selected to be in the inaugural class of Fulbright-National Geographic Digital Storytelling Fellows. She was recently a visiting faculty member at Bennington College, and currently is teaching at NYU.
